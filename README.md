## Features
- Create subjects with a title, an abbreviation and a color
- Create tasks that belong to a subject, have a title and a description and a due date and a reminder date
- Receive reminders in the form of notifications for tasks that are due soon.<br>
  When the tasks reminder date is today or has passed, the app will remind the user every day to complete the task until the task has been marked as completed.
- Create an account to sync your tasks across your devices and receive notifications on all of them
- Alternatively, use the app without an account to have all data stored locally.<br>
  You can later still migrate your account to a cloud based one. This will not delete any data.
- When a task is deleted, it is moved into a trash bin. The task can be viewed there for another 30 days, before it is permanently deleted. The user can choose to permanently delete the task themselves.
